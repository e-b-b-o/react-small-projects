# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# react-small-projects

Small React projects created while learning React through tutorials and practice. Each project explores a different React topic such as state, events, and component structure.

🚀 React Small Projects & Challenges

This repository contains a collection of small React projects and challenges built while learning and practicing React.
Each project focuses on a specific React concept, helping reinforce understanding through hands-on implementation.

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

Practice React step by step

Understand core concepts by building small things

Turn tutorials into real understanding

Build confidence before moving to larger projects

This repo is about learning by doing, not perfection.

🧠 Topics Covered

Projects in this repository cover topics such as:

useState

Event handling

Rendering lists

Component structure

Props & basic data flow

Simple UI logic

More topics will be added as learning progresses 📈

📁 Project Structure
react-challenges/
├─ useState-challenge/
├─ travel-list/
├─ counter-app/
└─ ...

Each folder represents a small standalone project focused on one idea.

🛠️ Tech Stack

React

JavaScript (ES6+)

CSS

Create React App (for learning purposes)

📚 Learning Philosophy

“Small projects. Clear concepts. Consistent practice.”

Instead of rushing to frameworks and complexity, this repo focuses on:

understanding why things work

writing simple, readable code

building habits that scale later

🔄 Work in Progress

This repository is actively updated as new topics are learned and new challenges are completed.
